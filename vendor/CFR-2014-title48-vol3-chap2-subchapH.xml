          <P>As prescribed in 204.7109(b), insert the following provision:</P>
          <EXTRACT>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Alternative Line-Item Structure (SEP 2011)</HD>
            <P>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</P>
            <P>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.</P>

The term “illegal drugs” does not mean the use of a controlled substance pursuant to a valid prescription or other uses authorized by law.</P>
            <P>(b) The Contractor agrees to institute and maintain a program for achieving the objective of a drug-free work force. While this clause defines criteria for such a program, contractors are encouraged to implement alternative approaches comparable to the criteria in paragraph (c) that are designed to achieve the objectives of this clause.</P>
            <P>(c) Contractor programs shall include the following, or appropriate alternatives:</P>

            <P>(i) The Contractor shall establish a program that provides for testing for the use of illegal drugs by employees in sensitive positions. The extent of and criteria for such testing shall be determined by the Contractor based on considerations that include the nature of the work being performed under the contract, the employee's duties, the efficient use of Contractor resources, and the risks to health, safety, or national security that could result from the failure of an employee adequately to discharge his or her position.</P>
            <P>(ii) In addition, the Contractor may establish a program for employee drug testing—</P>
            <P>(A) When there is a reasonable suspicion that an employee uses illegal drugs; or</P>
            <P>(B) When an employee has been involved in an accident or unsafe practice;</P>
            <P>(C) As part of or as a follow-up to counseling or rehabilitation for illegal drug use;</P>
            <P>(D) As part of a voluntary employee drug testing program.</P>
            <P>(iii) The Contractor may establish a program to test applicants for employment for illegal drug use.</P>
            <P>(iv) For the purpose of administering this clause, testing for illegal drugs may be limited to those substances for which testing is prescribed by section 2.1 of subpart B of the “Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs” (53 FR 11980 (April 11 1988)), issued by the Department of Health and Human Services.</P>
            <P>(d) Contractors shall adopt appropriate personnel procedures to deal with employees who are found to be using drugs illegally. Contractors shall not allow any employee to remain on duty or perform in a sensitive position who is found to use illegal drugs until such times as the Contractor, in accordance with procedures established by the Contractor, determines that the employee may perform in such a position.</P>
            <P>(e) The provisions of this clause pertaining to drug testing program shall not apply to the extent they are inconsistent with state or local law, or with an existing collective bargaining agreement; provided that with respect to the latter, the Contractor agrees that those issues that are in conflict will be a subject of negotiation at the next collective bargaining session.</P>

            </P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Combatant Commander</E> means the commander of a unified or specified combatant command established in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 161.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Contractors authorized to accompany the Force,</E> or <E T="03">CAAF,</E> means contractor personnel, including all tiers of subcontractor personnel, who are authorized to accompany U.S. Armed Forces in applicable operations and have been afforded CAAF status through a letter of authorization. CAAF generally include all U.S. citizen and third-country national employees not normally residing within the operational area whose area of performance is in the direct vicinity of U.S. Armed Forces and who routinely are collocated with the U.S. Armed Forces (especially in non-permissive environments). Personnel collocated with U.S. Armed Forces shall be afforded CAAF status through a letter of authorization. In some cases, Combatant Commander subordinate commanders may designate mission-essential host nation or local national contractor employees (e.g., interpreters) as CAAF. CAAF includes contractors previously identified as contractors deploying with the U.S. Armed Forces. CAAF status does not apply to contractor personnel in support of applicable operations within the boundaries and territories of the United States.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Designated operational area</E> means a geographic area designated by the combatant commander or subordinate joint force commander for the conduct or support of specified military operations.</P>

              <E T="03">Law of war</E> means that part of international law that regulates the conduct of armed hostilities. The law of war encompasses all international law for the conduct of hostilities binding on the United States or its individual citizens, including treaties and international agreements to which the United States is a party, and applicable customary international law.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Non-CAAF</E> means personnel who are not designated as CAAF, such as local national (LN) employees and non-LN employees who are permanent residents in the operational area or third-country nationals not routinely residing with U.S. Armed Forces (and third-country national expatriates who are permanent residents in the operational area) who perform support functions away from the close proximity of, and do not reside with, U.S. Armed Forces. Government-furnished support to non-CAAF is typically limited to force protection, emergency medical care, and basic human needs (e.g., bottled water, latrine facilities, security, and food when necessary) when performing their jobs in the direct vicinity of U.S. Armed Forces. Non-CAAF status does not apply to contractor personnel in support of applicable operations within the boundaries and territories of the United States.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Subordinate joint force commander</E> means a sub-unified commander or joint task force commander.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) This clause applies to both CAAF and non-CAAF when performing in a designated operational area outside the United States to support U.S. Armed Forces deployed outside the United States in—</P>

            <P>(iii) Peace operations, consistent with Joint Publication 3-07.3; or</P>
            <P>(iv) Other military operations or military exercises, when designated by the Combatant Commander or as directed by the Secretary of Defense.</P>
            <P>(2) Contract performance in support of U.S. Armed Forces deployed outside the United States may require work in dangerous or austere conditions. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Contractor accepts the risks associated with required contract performance in such operations.</P>
            <P>(3) When authorized in accordance with paragraph (j) of this clause to carry arms for personal protection, Contractor personnel are only authorized to use force for individual self-defense.</P>
            <P>(4) Unless immune from host nation jurisdiction by virtue of an international agreement or international law, inappropriate use of force by contractor personnel authorized to accompany the U.S. Armed Forces can subject such personnel to United States or host nation prosecution and civil liability (see paragraphs (d) and (j)(3) of this clause).</P>
            <P>(5) Service performed by Contractor personnel subject to this clause is not active duty or service under 38 U.S.C. 106 note.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Support.</E> (1)(i) The Combatant Commander will develop a security plan for protection of Contractor personnel in locations where there is not sufficient or legitimate civil authority, when the Combatant Commander decides it is in the interests of the Government to provide security because—</P>
            <P>(A) The Contractor cannot obtain effective security services;</P>
            <P>(B) Effective security services are unavailable at a reasonable cost; or</P>
            <P>(C) Threat conditions necessitate security through military means.</P>
            <P>(ii) In appropriate cases, the Combatant Commander may provide security through military means, commensurate with the level of security provided DoD civilians.</P>

            <P>(2)(i) Generally, CAAF will be afforded emergency medical and dental care if injured while supporting applicable operations. Additionally, non-CAAF employees who are injured while in the vicinity of U.S. Armed <PRTPAGE P="470"/>Forces will normally receive emergency medical and dental care. Emergency medical and dental care includes medical care situations in which life, limb, or eyesight is jeopardized. Examples of emergency medical and dental care include examination and initial treatment of victims of sexual assault; refills of prescriptions for life-dependent drugs; repair of broken bones, lacerations, infections; and traumatic injuries to the dentition. Hospitalization will be limited to stabilization and short-term medical treatment with an emphasis on return to duty or placement in the patient movement system.</P>
            <P>(ii) When the Government provides medical treatment or transportation of Contractor personnel to a selected civilian facility, the Contractor shall ensure that the Government is reimbursed for any costs associated with such treatment or transportation.</P>
            <P>(iii) Medical or dental care beyond this standard is not authorized.</P>
            <P>(3) Contractor personnel must have a Synchronized Predeployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT)-generated letter of authorization signed by the Contracting Officer in order to process through a deployment center or to travel to, from, or within the designated operational area. The letter of authorization also will identify any additional authorizations, privileges, or Government support that Contractor personnel are entitled to under this contract.Contractor personnel who are issued a letter of authorization shall carry it with them at all times while deployed.</P>
            <P>(4) Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, the Contractor is responsible for all other support required for its personnel engaged in the designated operational area under this contract.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Compliance with laws and regulations.</E> (1) The Contractor shall comply with, and shall ensure that its personnel supporting U.S. Armed Forces deployed outside the United States as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause are familiar with and comply with, all applicable—</P>
            <P>(i) United States, host country, and third country national laws;</P>
            <P>(ii) Provisions of the law of war, as well as any other applicable treaties and international agreements;</P>
            <P>(iii) United States regulations, directives, instructions, policies, and procedures; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Orders, directives, and instructions issued by the Combatant Commander, including those relating to force protection, security, health, safety, or relations and interaction with local nationals.</P>
            <P>(2) The Contractor shall institute and implement an effective program to prevent violations of the law of war by its employees and subcontractors, including law of war training in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(vii) of this clause.</P>
            <P>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that CAAF are aware—</P>
            <P>(i) Of the DoD definition of “sexual assault” in DoDD 6495.01, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program;</P>
            <P>(ii) That many of the offenses addressed by the definition are covered under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (see paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this clause). Other sexual misconduct may constitute offenses under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Federal law, such as the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, or host nation laws;</P>
            <P>(iii) That the offenses not covered by the Uniform Code of Military Justice may nevertheless have consequences to the contractor employees (see paragraph (h)(1) of this clause).</P>

          <P>As prescribed in 227.7103-6(a), use the following clause:</P>
          <EXTRACT>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items (FEB 2014)</HD>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this clause—</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Computer data base</E> means a collection of data recorded in a form capable of being processed by a computer. The term does not include computer software.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Computer program</E> means a set of instructions, rules, or routines recorded in a form that is capable of causing a computer to perform a specific operation or series of operations.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Computer software</E> means computer programs, source code, source code listings, object code listings, design details, algorithms, processes, flow charts, formulae and related material that would enable the software to be reproduced, recreated, or recompiled. Computer software does not include computer data bases or computer software documentation.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Computer software documentation</E> means owner's manuals, user's manuals, installation instructions, operating instructions, and other similar items, regardless of storage medium, that explain the capabilities of the computer software or provide instructions for using the software.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Covered Government support contractor</E> means a contractor (other than a litigation support contractor covered by 252.204-7014)under a contract, the primary purpose of which is to furnish independent and impartial advice or technical assistance directly to the Government in support of the Government's management and oversight of a program or effort (rather than to directly furnish an end item or service to accomplish a program or effort), provided that the contractor—</P>
            <P>(i) Is not affiliated with the prime contractor or a first-tier subcontractor on the program or effort, or with any direct competitor of such prime contractor or any such first-tier subcontractor in furnishing end items or services of the type developed or produced on the program or effort; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Receives access to technical data or computer software for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.</P>

            <P>(7) <E T="03">Developed</E> means that an item, component, or process exists and is workable. Thus, the item or component must have been constructed or the process practiced. Workability is generally established when the item, component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that there is a high probability that it will operate as intended. Whether, how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, and the state of the art. To be considered “developed,” the item, component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component, or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 35 of the United States Code.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Developed exclusively at private expense</E> means development was accomplished entirely with costs charged to indirect cost pools, costs not allocated to a government contract, or any combination thereof.</P>
            <P>(i) Private expense determinations should be made at the lowest practicable level.</P>

            <P>(ii) Under fixed-price contracts, when total costs are greater than the firm-fixed-price or ceiling price of the contract, the additional <PRTPAGE P="488"/>development costs necessary to complete development shall not be considered when determining whether development was at government, private, or mixed expense.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Developed exclusively with government funds</E> means development was not accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense.</P>
            <P>(10) <E T="03">Developed with mixed funding</E> means development was accomplished partially with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not allocated to a government contract, and partially with costs charged directly to a government contract.</P>
            <P>(11) <E T="03">Form, fit, and function data</E> means technical data that describes the required overall physical, functional, and performance characteristics (along with the qualification requirements, if applicable) of an item, component, or process to the extent necessary to permit identification of physically and functionally interchangeable items.</P>
            <P>(12) <E T="03">Government purpose</E> means any activity in which the United States Government is a party, including cooperative agreements with international or multi-national defense organizations, or sales or transfers by the United States Government to foreign governments or international organizations. Government purposes include competitive procurement, but do not include the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data for commercial purposes or authorize others to do so.</P>
            <P>(13) <E T="03">Government purpose rights</E> means the rights to—</P>
            <P>(i) Use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data within the Government without restriction; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Release or disclose technical data outside the Government and authorize persons to whom release or disclosure has been made to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose that data for United States government purposes.</P>
            <P>(14) <E T="03">Limited rights</E> means the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data, in whole or in part, within the Government. The Government may not, without the written permission of the party asserting limited rights, release or disclose the technical data outside the Government, use the technical data for manufacture, or authorize the technical data to be used by another party, except that the Government may reproduce, release, or disclose such data or authorize the use or reproduction of the data by persons outside the Government if—</P>
            <P>(i) The reproduction, release, disclosure, or use is—</P>
            <P>(A) Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or</P>
            <P>(B) A release or disclosure to—</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) A covered Government support contractor in performance of its covered Government support contract for use, modification, reproduction, performance, display, or release or disclosure to a person authorized to receive limited rights technical data; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A foreign government, of technical data other than detailed manufacturing or process data, when use of such data by the foreign government is in the interest of the Government and is required for evaluational or informational purposes;</P>
            <P>(ii) The recipient of the technical data is subject to a prohibition on the further reproduction, release, disclosure, or use of the technical data; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction is notified of such reproduction, release, disclosure, or use.</P>
            <P>(15) <E T="03">Technical data</E> means recorded information, regardless of the form or method of the recording, of a scientific or technical nature (including computer software documentation). The term does not include computer software or data incidental to contract administration, such as financial and/or management information.</P>
            <P>(16) <E T="03">Unlimited rights</E> means rights to use, modify, reproduce, perform, display, release, or disclose technical data in whole or in part, in any manner, and for any purpose whatsoever, and to have or authorize others to do so.</P>

            <P>(1) <E T="03">Unlimited rights.</E> The Government shall have unlimited rights in technical data that are—</P>

            <P>(iii) Created exclusively with Government funds in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes;</P>
            <P>(iv) Form, fit, and function data;</P>
            <P>(v) Necessary for installation, operation, maintenance, or training purposes (other than detailed manufacturing or process data);</P>
            <P>(vi) Corrections or changes to technical data furnished to the Contractor by the Government;</P>

            <P>(vii) Otherwise publicly available or have been released or disclosed by the Contractor <PRTPAGE P="489"/>or subcontractor without restrictions on further use, release or disclosure, other than a release or disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the technical data to another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or its assets to another party;</P>
            <P>(viii) Data in which the Government has obtained unlimited rights under another Government contract or as a result of negotiations; or</P>
            <P>(ix) Data furnished to the Government, under this or any other Government contract or subcontract thereunder, with—</P>
            <P>(A) Government purpose license rights or limited rights and the restrictive condition(s) has/have expired; or</P>
            <P>(B) Government purpose rights and the Contractor's exclusive right to use such data for commercial purposes has expired.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Government purpose rights.</E> (i) The Government shall have government purpose rights for a five-year period, or such other period as may be negotiated, in technical data—</P>
            <P>(A) That pertain to items, components, or processes developed with mixed funding except when the Government is entitled to unlimited rights in such data as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(iv) through (b)(1)(ix) of this clause; or</P>

Correction of nonconforming markings is not subject to the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clause of this contract. If the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor of a nonconforming marking and the Contractor fails to remove or correct such marking within sixty (60) days, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, remove or correct any nonconforming marking.</P>

            <P>(i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in subcontractor or supplier technical data, if the subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such rights under any other Government contract or under a license conveying the rights to the Government; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, or mailing the documents or other media in which the technical data will be delivered.</P>

            <P>(2) Whenever any technical data for noncommercial items, or for commercial items developed in any part at Government expense, is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same clause in the subcontract or other contractual instrument, including subcontracts or other contractual instruments for commercial items, and require its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to identify the parties. This clause will govern the technical data pertaining to noncommercial items or to any portion of a commercial item that was developed in any part at Government expense, and the clause at 252.227-7015 will govern the technical data pertaining to any portion of a commercial item that was developed exclusively at private expense. No other clause shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher-tier subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's technical data.</P>
            <P>(3) Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or supplier shall normally be delivered to the next higher-tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the prime contract for data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such data directly to the Government, rather than through a higher-tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.</P>
            <P>(4) The Contractor and higher-tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in technical data from their subcontractors or suppliers.</P>
            <P>(5) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligations to the Government.</P>

            <P>(i) (Applicable to technical data other than computer software documentation.) An item, component, or process, exists and is workable. Thus, the item or component must have been constructed or the process practiced. Workability is generally established when the item, component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that there is a high probability that it will operate as intended. Whether, how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, and the state of the art. To be considered “developed,” the item, component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 35 of the United States Code;</P>
            <P>(ii) A computer program has been successfully operated in a computer and tested to the extent sufficient to demonstrate to reasonable persons skilled in the art that the program can reasonably be expected to perform its intended purpose;</P>

            <P>(9) <E T="03">Developed exclusively at private expense</E> means development was accomplished entirely with costs charged to indirect cost pools, costs not allocated to a government contract, or any combination thereof.</P>
            <P>(i) Private expense determinations should be made at the lowest practicable level.</P>
            <P>(ii) Under fixed-price contracts, when total costs are greater than the firm-fixed-price or ceiling price of the contract, the additional development costs necessary to complete development shall not be considered when determining whether development was at government, private, or mixed expense.</P>
            <P>(10) <E T="03">Developed exclusively with government funds</E> means development was not accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense.</P>
            <P>(11) <E T="03">Developed with mixed funding</E> means development was accomplished partially with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not allocated to a government contract, and partially with costs charged directly to a government contract.</P>
            <P>(12) <E T="03">Form, fit, and function data</E> means technical data that describe the required overall physical, functional, and performance characteristics (along with the qualification requirements, if applicable) of an item, component, or process to the extent necessary to permit identification of physically and functionally interchangeable items.</P>

            <P>(15) “Limited rights” means the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data, in whole or in part, within the Government. The Government may not, without the written permission of the party asserting limited rights, release or disclose the technical data outside the Government, use the technical data for manufacture, or authorize the technical data to be used by another party, except that the Government may reproduce, release, or disclose such data or authorize the use or reproduction of the data by persons outside the Government if—</P>
            <P>(i) The reproduction, release, disclosure, or use is—</P>
            <P>(A) Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or</P>

            <P>(6) <E T="03">Pre-existing data markings.</E> If the terms of a prior contract or license permitted the Contractor to restrict the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or computer software, and those restrictions are still applicable, the Contractor may mark such data or software with the appropriate restrictive legend for which the data or software qualified under the prior contract or license. The marking procedures in paragraph (f)(1) of this clause shall be followed.</P>

Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning inspection and acceptance, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, correct or strike a marking if, in accordance with the applicable procedures of those clauses, a restrictive marking is determined to be unjustified.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Nonconforming markings.</E> A nonconforming marking is a marking placed on technical data or computer software delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government under this contract that is not in the format authorized by this contract. Correction of nonconforming markings is not subject to the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data or the Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software clause of this contract. If the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor of a nonconforming marking or markings and the Contractor fails to remove or correct such markings within sixty (6)) days, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, remove or correct any nonconforming markings.</P>

            <P>(2) The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this clause—</P>

            <P>(i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in subcontractor of supplier technical data or computer software, if the subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such rights under any other Government contract or under a license conveying the rights to the Government; and<PRTPAGE P="510"/>
            </P>

            <P>(k) <E T="03">Applicability to subcontractors or suppliers.</E> (1) the Contractor shall assure that the rights afforded its subcontractors and suppliers under 10 U.S.C. 2320, 10 U.S.C. 2321, and the identification, assertion, and delivery processes required by paragraph (e) of this clause are recognized and protected.</P>
            <P>(2) Whenever any noncommercial technical data or computer software is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same clause in the subcontract or other contractual instrument, and require its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to identify the parties. The Contractor shall use the Technical Data—Commercial Items clause of this contract to obtain technical data pertaining to commercial items, components, or processes. No other clause shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher tier subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's technical data or computer software.</P>
            <P>(3) Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or supplier shall normally be delivered to the next higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the prime contract for technical data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such technical data directly to the Government, rather than through a higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.</P>
            <P>(4) The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in technical data or computer software from their subcontractors or suppliers.</P>
            <P>(5) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data or computer software as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligation to the Government.</P>

          <P>As prescribed in 227.7104(e)(3) or 227.7203-6(c), use the following clause:</P>
          <EXTRACT>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software (SEP 2011)</HD>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> (1) As used in this clause, unless otherwise specifically indicated, the term “Contractor” means the Contractor and its subcontractors or suppliers.</P>
            <P>(2) Other terms used in this clause are defined in the Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation clause of this contract.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Justification.</E> The Contractor shall maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any markings that assert restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, perform, display, release, or disclose computer software delivered or required to be delivered under this contract and shall be prepared to furnish to the Contracting Officer a written justification for such restrictive markings in response to a request for information under paragraph (d) or a challenge under paragraph (f) of this clause.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Direct contact with subcontractors or suppliers.</E> The Contractor agrees that the Contracting Officer may transact matters under this clause directly with subcontractors or suppliers at any tier who assert restrictions on the Government's right to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software. Neither this clause, <PRTPAGE P="511"/>nor any action taken by the Government under this clause, creates or implies privity of contract between the Government and the Contractor's subcontractors or suppliers.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Requests for information.</E> (1) The Contracting Officer may request the Contractor to provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the Contractor's asserted restrictions. Such information shall be based upon the records required by this clause or other information reasonably available to the Contractor.</P>
            <P>(2) Based upon the information provided, if the—</P>
            <P>(i) Contractor agrees that an asserted restriction is not valid, the Contracting Officer may—</P>
            <P>(A) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at the Contractor's expense; or</P>
            <P>(B) Return the computer software to the Contractor for correction at the Contractor's expense. If the Contractor fails to correct or strike the unjustified restrictions and return the corrected software to the Contracting Officer within sixty (60) days following receipt of the software, the Contracting Officer may correct the strike the markings at the Contractor's expense.</P>
            <P>(ii) Contracting Officer concludes that the asserted restriction is appropriate for this contract, the Contracting Officer shall so notify the Contractor in writing.</P>
            <P>(3) The Contractor's failure to provide a timely response to a Contracting Officer's request for information or failure to provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate an asserted restriction shall constitute reasonable grounds for questioning the validity of an asserted restriction.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Government right to challenge and validate asserted restrictions.</E> (1) The Government, when there are reasonable grounds to do so, has the right to review and challenge the validity of any restrictions asserted by the Contractor on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software delivered, to be delivered under this contract, or otherwise provided to the Government in the performance of this contract. Except for software that is publicly available, has been furnished to the Government without restrictions, or has been otherwise made available without restrictions, the Government may exercise this right only within three years after the date(s) the software is delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government, or three years following final payment under this contract, whichever is later.</P>
            <P>(2) The absence of a challenge to an asserted restriction shall not constitute validation under this clause. Only a Contracting Officer's final decision or actions of an agency Board of Contract Appeals or a court of competent jurisdiction that sustain the validity of an asserted restriction constitute validation of the restriction.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Major systems.</E> When the Contracting Officer challenges an asserted restriction regarding noncommercial computer software for a major system or a subsystem or component thereof on the basis that the computer software was not developed exclusively at private expense, the Contracting Officer will sustain the challenge unless information provided by the Contractor or subcontractor demonstrates that the computer software was developed exclusively at private expense.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Challenge procedures.</E> (1) A challenge must be in writing and shall—</P>
            <P>(i) State the specific grounds for challenging the asserted restriction;</P>
            <P>(ii) Require the Contractor to respond within sixty (60) days;</P>
            <P>(iii) Require the Contractor to provide justification for the assertion based upon records kept in accordance with paragraph (b) of this clause and such other documentation that are reasonably available to the Contractor, in sufficient detail to enable the Contracting Officer to determine the validity of the asserted restrictions; and</P>
            <P>(iv) State that a Contracting Officer's final decision, during the three-year period preceding this challenge, or action of a court of competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals that sustained the validity of an identical assertion made by the Contractor (or a licensee) shall serve as justification for the asserted restriction.</P>
            <P>(2) The Contracting Officer shall extend the time for response if the Contractor submits a written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.</P>
            <P>(3) The Contracting Officer may request additional supporting documentation if, in the Contracting Officer's opinion, the Contractor's explanation does not provide sufficient evidence to justify the validity of the asserted restrictions. The Contractor agrees to promptly respond to the Contracting Officer's request for additional supporting documentation.</P>
            <P>(4) Notwithstanding challenge by the Contracting Officer, the parties may agree on the disposition of an asserted restriction at any time prior to a Contracting Officer's final decision or, if the Contractor has appealed that decision, filed suit, or provided notice of an intent to file suit, at any time prior to a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals.</P>

            <P>(5) If the Contractor fails to respond to the Contracting Officer's request for information or additional information under paragraph (g)(1) of this clause, the Contracting Officer will issue a final decision, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this clause and the Disputes clause of this contract, pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction.<PRTPAGE P="512"/>
            </P>
            <P>(6) If the Contracting Officer, after reviewing the written explanation furnished pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this clause, or any other available information pertaining to the validity of an asserted restriction, determines that the asserted restriction has—</P>
            <P>(i) Not been justified, the Contracting Officer shall issue promptly a final decision, in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, denying the validity of the asserted restriction; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Been justified, the Contracting Officer shall issue promptly a final decision, in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, validating the asserted restriction.</P>
            <P>(7) A Contractor receiving challenges to the same asserted restriction(s) from more than one Contracting Officer shall notify each Contracting Officer of the other challenges. The notice shall also state which Contracting Officer initiated the first in time unanswered challenge. The Contracting Officer who initiated the first in time unanswered challenge, after consultation with the other Contracting Officers who have challenged the restrictions and the Contractor, shall formulate and distribute a schedule that provides the contractor a reasonable opportunity for responding to each challenge.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Contractor appeal—Government obligation.</E> (1) The Government agrees that, notwithstanding a Contracting Officer's final decision denying the validity of an asserted restriction and except as provided in paragraph (h)(3) of this clause, it will honor the asserted restriction—</P>
            <P>(i) For a period of ninety (90) days from the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision to allow the Contractor to appeal to the appropriate Board of Contract Appeals or to file suit in an appropriate court;</P>
            <P>(ii) For a period of one year from the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision if, within the first ninety (90) days following the Contracting Officer's final decision, the Contractor has provided notice of an intent to file suit in an appropriate court; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Until final disposition by the appropriate Board of Contract Appeals or court of competent jurisdiction, if the Contractor has: (A) appealed to the Board of Contract Appeals or filed suit an appropriate court within ninety (90) days; or (B) submitted, within ninety (90) days, a notice of intent to file suit in an appropriate court and filed suit within one year.</P>
            <P>(2) The Contractor agrees that the Government may strike, correct, or ignore the restrictive markings if the Contractor fails to—</P>
            <P>(i) Appeal to a Board of Contract Appeals within ninety (90) days from the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision;</P>
            <P>(ii) File suit in an appropriate court within ninety (90) days from such date; or</P>
            <P>(iii) File suit within one year after the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision if the Contractor had provided notice of intent to file suit within ninety (90) days following the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision.</P>
            <P>(3) The agency head, on a nondelegable basis, may determine that urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit awaiting the filing of suit in an appropriate court, or the rendering of a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals. In that event, the agency head shall notify the Contractor of the urgent or compelling circumstances. Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(1) of this clause, the Contractor agrees that the agency may use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software marked with (i) government purpose legends for any purpose, and authorize others to do so; or (ii) restricted or special license rights for government purposes only. The Government agrees not to release or disclose such software unless, prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), or is a Government contractor receiving access to the software for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at DFARS 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends. The agency head's determination may be made at any time after the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision and shall not affect the Contractor's right to damages against the United States, or other relief provided by law, if its asserted restrictions are ultimately upheld.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Final disposition of appeal or suit.</E> If the Contractor appeals or files suit and if, upon final disposition of the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer's decision is:</P>
            <P>(1) Sustained—</P>
            <P>(i) Any restrictive marking on such computer software shall be struck or corrected at the contractor's expense or ignored; and</P>
            <P>(ii) If the asserted restriction is found not to be substantially justified, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for payment of the cost to the Government of reviewing the asserted restriction and the fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Government in challenging the restriction, unless special circumstances would make such payment unjust.</P>
            <P>(2) Not sustained—</P>
            <P>(i) The Government shall be bound by the asserted restriction; and</P>

            <P>(ii) If the challenge by the Government is found not to have been made in good faith, the Government shall be liable to the Contractor for payment of fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) <PRTPAGE P="513"/>incurred by the Contractor in defending the restriction.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Flowdown.</E> The Contractor shall insert this clause in all contracts, purchase orders, and other similar instruments with its subcontractors or suppliers, at any tier, who will be furnishing computer software to the Government in the performance of this contract. The clause may not be altered other than to identify the appropriate parties.</P>

The Contracting Officer shall not challenge such assertions unless the Contracting Officer has information that demonstrates that the item, component, or process was not developed exclusively at private expense.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Major systems.</E> The presumption of development exclusively at private expense does not apply to major systems or subsystems or components thereof, except for commercially available off-the-shelf items (which are governed by paragraph (b)(1) of this clause). When the Contracting Officer challenges an asserted restriction regarding technical data for a major system or a subsystem or component thereof on the basis that the item, component, or process was not developed exclusively at private expense, the Contracting Officer will sustain the challenge unless information provided by the Contractor or subcontractor demonstrates that the item, component, or process was developed exclusively at private expense.</P>

Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the Contractor or subcontractor shall be prepared to furnish to the Contracting Officer a written justification for such restrictive markings in response to a challenge under paragraph (e) of this clause.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Prechallenge request for information.</E> (1) The Contracting Officer may request the Contractor or subcontractor to furnish a written explanation for any restriction asserted by the Contractor or subcontractor on the right of the United States or others to use technical data. If, upon review of the explanation submitted, the Contracting Officer remains unable to ascertain the basis of the restrictive marking, the Contracting Officer may further request the Contractor or subcontractor to furnish additional information in the records of, or otherwise in the possession of or reasonably available to, the Contractor or subcontractor to justify the validity of any restrictive marking on technical data delivered or to be delivered under the contract or subcontract (e.g., a statement of facts accompanied with supporting documentation). The Contractor or subcontractor shall submit such written data as requested by the Contracting Officer within the time required or such longer period as may be mutually agreed.</P>
            <P>(2) If the Contracting Officer, after reviewing the written data furnished pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this clause, or any other available information pertaining to the validity of a restrictive marking, determines that reasonable grounds exist to question the current validity of the marking and that continued adherence to the marking would make impracticable the subsequent competitive acquisition of the item, component, or process to which the technical data relates, the Contracting Officer shall follow the procedures in paragraph (e) of this clause.</P>

            <P>(3) If the Contractor or subcontractor fails to respond to the Contracting Officer's request for information under paragraph (d)(1) of this clause, and the Contracting Officer determines that continued adherence to the <PRTPAGE P="519"/>marking would make impracticable the subsequent competitive acquisition of the item, component, or process to which the technical data relates, the Contracting Officer may challenge the validity of the marking as described in paragraph (e) of this clause.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Challenge.</E> (1) Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning inspection and acceptance, if the Contracting Officer determines that a challenge to the restrictive marking is warranted, the Contracting Officer shall send a written challenge notice to the Contractor or subcontractor asserting the restrictive markings. Such challenge shall—</P>
            <P>(i) State the specific grounds for challenging the asserted restriction;</P>
            <P>(ii) Require a response within sixty (60) days justifying and providing sufficient evidence as to the current validity of the asserted restriction;</P>
            <P>(iii) State that a DoD Contracting Officer's final decision, issued pursuant to paragraph (g) of this clause, sustaining the validity of a restrictive marking identical to the asserted restriction, within the three-year period preceding the challenge, shall serve as justification for the asserted restriction if the validated restriction was asserted by the same Contractor or subcontractor (or any licensee of such Contractor or subcontractor) to which such notice is being provided; and</P>
            <P>(iv) State that failure to respond to the challenge notice may result in issuance of a final decision pursuant to paragraph (f) of this clause.</P>
            <P>(2) The Contracting Officer shall extend the time for response as appropriate if the Contractor or subcontractor submits a written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.</P>
            <P>(3) The Contractor's or subcontractor's written response shall be considered a claim within the meaning of the 41 U.S.C. 7101, Contract Disputes and shall be certified in the form prescribed at 33.207 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, regardless of dollar amount.</P>
            <P>(4) A Contractor or subcontractor receiving challenges to the same restrictive markings from more than one Contracting Officer shall notify each Contracting Officer of the existence of more than one challenge. The notice shall also state which Contracting Officer initiated the first in time unanswered challenge. The Contracting Officer initiating the first in time unanswered challenge after consultation with the Contractor or subcontractor and the other Contracting Officers, shall formulate and distribute a schedule for responding to each of the challenge notices to all interested parties. The schedule shall afford the Contractor or subcontractor an opportunity to respond to each challenge notice. All parties will be bound by this schedule.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Final decision when Contractor or subcontractor fails to respond.</E> Upon a failure of a Contractor or subcontractor to submit any response to the challenge notice the Contracting Officer will issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor in accordance with paragraph (b) of this clause and the Disputes clause of this contract pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction. This final decision shall be issued as soon as possible after the expiration of the time period of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) or (e)(2) of this clause. Following issuance of the final decision, the Contracting Officer will comply with the procedures in paragraphs (g)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this clause.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Final decision when Contractor or subcontractor responds.</E> (1) if the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor or subcontractor has justified the validity of the restrictive marking, the Contracting Officer shall issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor sustaining the validity of the restrictive marking, and stating that the Government will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking. This final decision shall be issued within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Contractor's or subcontractor's response to the challenge notice, or within such longer period that the Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor or subcontractor that the Government will require. The notification of a longer period for issuance of a final decision will be made within sixty (60) days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) If the Contracting Officer determines that the validity of the restrictive marking is not justified, the Contracting Officer shall issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract. Notwithstanding paragraph (e) of the Disputes clause, the final decision shall be issued within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Contractor's or subcontractor's response to the challenge notice, or within such longer period that the Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor or subcontractor of the longer period that the Government will require. The notification of a longer period for issuance of a final decision will be made within sixty (60) days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice.</P>

            <P>(ii) The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking of a period of ninety (90) days from the issuance of the Contracting Officer's final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause. The Contractor or subcontractor agrees that, if it intends to file suit in the United States Claims Court it will provide a notice of intent to file suit to the Contracting Officer within ninety (90) days from the issuance of the Contracting Officer's final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of <PRTPAGE P="520"/>this clause. If the Contractor or subcontractor fails to appeal, file suit, or provide a notice of intent to file suit to the Contracting Officer within the ninety (90)-day period, the Government may cancel or ignore the restrictive markings, and the failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to take the required action constitutes agreement with such Government action.</P>
            <P>(iii) The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking where a notice of intent to file suit in the United States Claims Court is provided to the Contracting Officer within ninety (90) days from the issuance of the final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause. The Government will no longer be bound, and the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the Government may strike or ignore the restrictive markings, if the Contractor or subcontractor fails to file its suit within one (1) year after issuance of the final decision. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the head of an agency determines, on a nondelegable basis, that urgent or compelling circumstances will not permit waiting for the filing of a suit in the United States Claims Court, the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the agency may, following notice to the Contractor or subcontractor, authorize release or disclosure of the technical data. Such agency determination may be made at any time after issuance of the final decision and will not affect the Contractor's or subcontractor's right to damages against the United States where its restrictive markings are ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided by law.</P>
            <P>(iv) The Government agrees that it will be bound by the restrictive marking where an appeal or suit is filed pursuant to the Contract Disputes statute  until final disposition by an agency Board of Contract Appeals or the United States Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the head of an agency determines, on a nondelegable basis, following notice to the Contractor that urgent or compelling circumstances will not permit awaiting the decision by such Board of Contract Appeals or the United States Claims Court, the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the agency may authorize release or disclosure of the technical data. Such agency determination may be made at any time after issuance of the final decision and will not affect the Contractor's or subcontractor's right to damages against the United States where its restrictive markings are ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided by law.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Final disposition of appeal or suit.</E> (1) If the Contractor or subcontractor appeals or files suit and if, upon final disposition of the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer's decision is sustained—</P>
            <P>(i) The restrictive marking on the technical data shall be cancelled, corrected or ignored; and</P>
            <P>(ii) If the restrictive marking is found not to be substantially justified, the Contractor or subcontractor, as appropriate, shall be liable to the Government for payment of the cost to the Government of reviewing the restrictive marking and the fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Government in challenging the marking, unless special circumstances would make such payment unjust.</P>
            <P>(2) If the Contractor or subcontractor appeals or files suit and if, upon final disposition of the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer's decision is not sustained—</P>
            <P>(i) The Government shall continue to be bound by the restrictive marking; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The Government shall be liable to the Contractor or subcontractor for payment of fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Contractor or subcontractor in defending the marking, if the challenge by the Government is found not to have been made in good faith.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Duration of right to challenge.</E> The Government may review the validity of any restriction on technical data, delivered or to be delivered under a contract, asserted by the Contractor or subcontractor. During the period within three (3) years of final payment on a contract or within three (3) years of delivery of the technical data to the Government, whichever is later, the Contracting Officer may review and make a written determination to challenge the restriction. The Government may, however, challenge a restriction on the release, disclosure or use of technical data at any time if such technical data—</P>
            <P>(1) Is publicly available;</P>
            <P>(2) Has been furnished to the United States without restriction; or</P>
            <P>(3) Has been otherwise made available without restriction. Only the Contracting Officer's final decision resolving a formal challenge by sustaining the validity of a restrictive marking constitutes “validation” as addressed in 10 U.S.C. 2321.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Decision not to challenge.</E> A decision by the Government, or a determination by the Contracting Officer, to not challenge the restrictive marking or asserted restriction shall not constitute “validation.”</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Privity of contract.</E> The Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the Contracting Officer may transact matters under this clause directly with subcontractors at any tier that assert restrictive markings. However, this clause neither creates nor implies privity of contract between the Government and subcontractors.</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Flowdown.</E> The Contractor or subcontractor agrees to insert this clause in contractual instruments, including subcontracts <PRTPAGE P="521"/>and other contractual instruments for commercial items, with its subcontractors or suppliers at any tier requiring the delivery of technical data.</P>

Orders for equipment, materials, and supplies placed prior to official notification of such approval shall be at the Contractor's own risk. The Contractor must submit its documentation in sufficient time to permit processing by the appropriate United States and Spanish Government agencies prior to the arrival of the equipment, material, or supplies in Spain. Seasonal variations in processing times are common, and the Contractor should program its projects accordingly. Any delay or expense arising directly or indirectly from this process shall not excuse untimely performance (except as expressly allowed in other provisions of this contract), constitute a direct or constructive change, or otherwise provide a basis for additional compensation or adjustment of any kind.</P>
            <P>(d) To ensure that all duty-free imports are properly accounted for, exported, or disposed of, in accordance with Spanish law, the Contractor shall obtain a written bank letter of guaranty payable to the Treasurer of the United States, or such other authority as may be designated by the Contracting Officer, in the amount set forth in paragraph (g) of this clause, prior to effecting any duty-free imports for the performance of this contract.</P>
            <P>(e) If the Contractor fails to obtain the required guaranty, the Contractor agrees that the Contracting Officer may withhold a portion of the contract payments in order to establish a fund in the amount set forth in paragraph (g) of this clause. The fund shall be used for the payment of import taxes in the event that the Contractor fails to properly account for, export, or dispose of equipment, materials, or supplies imported on a duty-free basis.</P>
            <P>(f) The amount of the bank letter of guaranty or size of the fund required under paragraph (d) or (e) of this clause normally shall be 5 percent of the contract value. However, if the Contractor demonstrates to the Contracting Officer's satisfaction that the amount retained by the United States Government or guaranteed by the bank is excessive, the amount shall be reduced to an amount commensurate with contingent import tax and duty-free liability. This bank guaranty or fund shall not be released to the Contractor until the Spanish General Directorate of Customs verifies the accounting, export, or disposition of the equipment, material, or supplies imported on a duty-free basis.</P>

            <P>(g) The amount required under paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this clause is (<E T="03">Contracting Officer insert amount at time of contract award).</E>
            </P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Limitation of Government's Obligation (APR 2014)</HD>
            <P>(a) Contract line item(s) <E T="03">[Contracting Officer insert after negotiations]</E> is/are incrementally funded. For this/these item(s), the sum of $__ <E T="03">[Contracting Officer insert after negotiations]</E> of the total price is presently available for payment and allotted to this contract. An allotment schedule is set forth in paragraph (j) of this clause.</P>
            <P>(b) For item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount currently allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be obligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government.” As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for those items(s).</P>
            <P>(c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable item(s). The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (j) of this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date. The notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for a subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If after such notification additional funds are not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed substitute date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any item(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government.”</P>
            <P>(d) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the parties will agree as to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds. The provisions of paragraph (b) through (d) of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified accordingly.</P>
            <P>(e) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient for timely performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or both. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled “Disputes.”</P>

            </P>
            <P>(g) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled “Default.” The provisions of this clause are limited to the work and allotment of funds for the contract line item(s) set forth in paragraph (a) of this clause. This clause no longer applies once the contract is fully funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable adjustments negotiated under paragraphs (d) or (e) of this clause.</P>
            <P>(h) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to terminate this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government.”</P>
            <P>(i) Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342.</P>

            <P>(c) The Contractor shall not commence performance of research involving human subjects that is covered under 32 CFR Part 219 or that meets exemption criteria under 32 CFR 219.101(b), or expend funding on such effort, until and unless the conditions of either the following paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) have been met:</P>
            <P>(1) The Contractor furnishes to the HRPO, with a copy to the Contracting Officer, an assurance of compliance and IRB approval and receives notification from the Contracting Officer that the HRPO has approved the assurance as appropriate for the research under the Statement of Work and also that the HRPO has reviewed the protocol and accepted the IRB approval for compliance with the DoD component policies. The Contractor may furnish evidence of an existing assurance of compliance for acceptance by the HRPO, if an appropriate assurance has been approved in connection with previous research. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer immediately of any suspensions or terminations of the assurance.</P>
            <P>(2) The Contractor furnishes to the HRPO, with a copy to the Contracting Officer, a determination that the human research proposed meets exemption criteria in 32 CFR 219.101(b) and receives written notification from the Contracting Officer that the exemption is determined acceptable. The determination shall include citation of the exemption category under 32 CFR 219.101(b) and a rationale statement. In the event of a disagreement regarding the Contractor's furnished exemption determination, the HRPO retains final judgment on what research activities or classes of research are covered or are exempt under the contract.</P>
            <P>(d) DoD staff, consultants, and advisory groups may independently review and inspect the Contractor's research and research procedures involving human subjects and, based on such findings, DoD may prohibit research that presents unacceptable hazards or otherwise fails to comply with DoD procedures.</P>

            <P>(i) The primary surfaces, comprising the surface of the runway, runway shoulders, and lateral safety zones. The length of each primary surface is the same as the runway length. The width of each primary surface is 2,000 feet (1,000 feet on each side of the runway centerline);</P>
            <P>(ii) The <E T="03">clear zone</E> beyond the ends of each runway, i.e., the extension of the primary surface for a distance of 1,000 feet beyond each end of each runway;</P>
            <P>(iii) All taxiways, plus the lateral clearance zones along each side for the length of the taxiways (the outer edge of each lateral clearance zone is laterally 250 feet from the far or opposite edge of the taxiway, e.g., a 75-foot-wide taxiway would have a combined width of taxiway and lateral clearance zones of 425 feet); and</P>

            <P>(i) The <E T="03">approach-departure clearance surface</E> is an extension of the primary surface and the clear zone at each end of each runway, for a distance of 50,000 feet, first along an inclined (glide angle) and then along a horizontal plane, both flaring symmetrically about the runway centerline extended.</P>

            <P>(A) The inclined plane (glide angle) begins in the clear zone 200 feet past the end of the runway (and primary surface) at the same elevation as the end of the runway. It continues upward at a slope of 50:1 (1 foot <PRTPAGE P="556"/>vertically for each 50 feet horizontally) to an elevation of 500 feet above the established airfield elevation. At that point the plane becomes horizontal, continuing at that same uniform elevation to a point 50,000 feet longitudinally from the beginning of the inclined plane (glide angle) and ending there.</P>

            <P>(4) Identify all vehicles it operates in landing areas by means of a flag on a staff attached to, and flying above, the vehicle.

The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of an increase or decrease in costs within ninety days after continued performance has been directed by the Contracting Officer, or within any additional period that the Contracting Officer approves in writing, but not later than the date of final payment under the contract. The Contractor's notice shall include the Contractor's proposal for an equitable adjustment and any data supporting the increase or decrease in the form prescribed by the Contracting Officer. The parties shall negotiate an equitable price adjustment to the contract price, delivery schedule, or both as soon as is practicable after receipt of the Contractor's proposal.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Cancellation or Termination of Orders (NOV 2005)</HD>
            <P>(a) If the Government cancels any of the services ordered under this agreement/contract, before the services are made available to the Government, or terminates any of these services after they are made available to the Government, the Government shall reimburse the Contractor for the actual nonrecoverable costs the Contractor has reasonably incurred in providing facilities and equipment for which the Contractor has no foreseeable reuse.</P>

            <P>(d) If no applicable tariffs are in effect on the date of cancellation or termination or set forth in the applicable CSA or other contractual document, the Government's liability will be determined under the following settlement procedures—</P>
            <P>(1) The Contractor agrees to provide the Contracting Officer, in such reasonable detail as the Contracting Officer may require, inventory schedules covering all items of property or facilities in the Contractor's possession, the cost of which is included in the Basic Cancellation or Termination Liability for which the Contractor has no foreseeable reuse.</P>
            <P>(2) The Contractor shall use its best efforts to sell property or facilities when the Contractor has no foreseeable reuse or when the Government has not exercised its option to take title under the title to Telecommunications Facilities and Equipment clause of this agreement/contract. The Contractor shall apply any proceeds of the sale to reduce any payments by the Government to the Contractor under a cancellation or termination settlement.</P>
            <P>(3) The Contractor shall record actual nonrecoverable costs under established accounting procedures prescribed by the cognizant governmental regulatory authority or, if no such procedures have been prescribed, under generally accepted accounting procedures applicable to the provision of telecommunication services for public use.</P>

            <P>(4) The actual nonrecoverable costs are the installed costs of the facilities and equipment, less cost of reusable materials, and less net salvage value. Installed costs shall include the actual cost of equipment and materials specifically provided or used, plus the <PRTPAGE P="569"/>actual cost of installing (including engineering, labor, supervision, transportation, rights-of-way, and any other items which are chargeable to the capital accounts of the Contractor) less any costs the Government may have directly reimbursed the Contractor under the Special Construction and Equipment Charges clause of this agreement/contract. Deduct from the Contractor's installed cost, the net salvage value (salvage value less cost of removal). In determining net salvage value, give consideration to foreseeable reuse of the facilities and equipment by the Contractor. Make allowance for the cost of dismantling, removal, reconditioning, and disposal of the facilities and equipment when necessary either to the sale of facilities or their reuse by the Contractor in another location.</P>
            <P>(5) The Basic Cancellation Liability is defined as the actual nonrecoverable cost which the Government shall reimburse the Contractor at the time services are cancelled.

            <P>(7) The Contractor agrees that, if after settlement but within the termination liability period of the services, should the Contractor make reuse of equipment or facilities which were treated as nonreusable or nonsalvagable in the settlement, the Contractor shall reimburse the Government for the value of the equipment or facilities.</P>

            <P>(i) Reallocations and any credit due are processed no less frequently than the routine billing cycle;</P>
            <P>(ii) Inventories retained for requirements that are not under contract are not allocated to contracts; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Algorithms are maintained based on valid and current data;</P>
            <P>(9) Have adequate controls to ensure that physically commingled inventories that may include material for which costs are charged or allocated to fixed-price, cost-reimbursement, and commercial contracts do not compromise requirements of any of the standards in paragraphs (d)(1) through (8) of this clause. Government-furnished material shall not be—</P>
            <P>(i) Physically commingled with other material; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Used on commercial work; and</P>

            <P>(e) <E T="03">Significant deficiencies.</E> (1) The Contracting Officer will provide an initial determination to the Contractor, in writing, of any significant deficiencies. The initial determination will describe the deficiency in sufficient detail to allow the Contractor to understand the deficiency.</P>

If the Contractor disagrees with the initial determination, the Contractor shall state, in writing, its rationale for disagreeing.</P>

            <P>(iv) If, within 90 days of receipt of the Contractor notification that the Contractor has corrected the significant deficiencies, the Contracting Officer has not made a determination in accordance with paragraphs (f)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this clause, the Contracting Officer will reduce withholding directly related to the significant deficiencies identified in the Contractor notification by at least 50 percent of the amount being withheld from progress payments and performance-based payments, and direct the Contractor, in writing, to reduce the payment withholding from billings on interim cost vouchers directly related to the significant deficiencies identified in the Contractor notification by a specified percentage that is at least 50 percent, but not authorize the Contractor to bill for any monies previously withheld until the Contracting Officer makes a determination in accordance with paragraphs (f)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this clause.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Ordering from Government supply sources.</SUBJECT>
          <P>As prescribed in 251.107, use the following clause:</P>
          <EXTRACT>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Ordering From Government Supply Sources (AUG 2012)</HD>
            <P>(a) When placing orders under Federal Supply Schedules, Personal Property Rehabilitation Price Schedules, or Enterprise Software Agreements, the Contractor shall follow the terms of the applicable schedule or agreement and authorization. Include in each order:</P>
            <P>(1) A copy of the authorization (unless a copy was previously furnished to the Federal Supply Schedule, Personal Property Rehabilitation Price Schedule, or Enterprise Software Agreement contractor).</P>
            <P>(2) The following statement: Any price reductions negotiated as part of an Enterprise Software Agreement issued under a Federal Supply Schedule contract shall control. In the event of any other inconsistencies between an Enterprise Software Agreement, established as a Federal Supply Schedule blanket purchase agreement, and the Federal Supply Schedule contract, the latter shall govern.</P>
            <P>(3) The completed address(es) to which the Contractor's mail, freight, and billing documents are to be directed.</P>
            <P>(b) When placing orders under nonmandatory schedule contracts and requirements contracts, issued by the General Services Administration (GSA) Office of Information Resources Management, for automated data processing equipment, software and maintenance, communications equipment and supplies, and teleprocessing services, the Contractor shall follow the terms of the applicable contract and the procedures in paragraph (a) of this clause.</P>
            <P>(c) When placing orders for Government stock on a reimbursable basis, the Contractor shall—</P>
            <P>(1) Comply with the requirements of the Contracting Officer's authorization, using FEDSTRIP or MILSTRIP procedures, as appropriate;</P>
            <P>(2) Use only the GSA Form 1948-A, Retail Services Shopping Plate, when ordering from GSA Self-Service Stores;</P>
            <P>(3) Order only those items required in the performance of Government contracts; and</P>
            <P>(4) Pay invoices from Government supply sources promptly. For purchases made from DoD supply sources, this means within 30 days of the date of a proper invoice. The Contractor shall annotate each invoice with the date of receipt. For purposes of computing interest for late Contractor payments, the Government's invoice is deemed to be a demand for payment in accordance with the Interest clause of this contract. The Contractor's failure to pay may also result in the DoD supply source refusing to honor the requisition (see DFARS 251.102(f)) or in the Contracting Officer terminating the Contractor's authorization to use DoD supply sources. In the event the Contracting Officer decides to terminate the authorization due to the Contractor's failure to pay in a timely manner, the Contracting Officer shall provide the Contractor with prompt written notice of the intent to terminate the authorization and the basis for such action. The Contractor shall have 10 days after receipt of the Government's notice in which to provide additional information as to why the authorization should not be terminated. The termination shall not provide the Contractor with an excusable delay for failure to perform or complete the contract in accordance with the terms of the contract, and the Contractor shall be solely responsible for any increased costs.</P>
            <P>(d) When placing orders for Government stock on a non-reimbursable basis, the Contractor shall—</P>
            <P>(1) Comply with the requirements of the Contracting Officer's authorization; and</P>
            <P>(2) When using electronic transactions to submit requisitions on a non-reimbursable basis only, place orders by authorizing contract number using the Defense Logistics Management System (DLMS) Supplement to Federal Implementation Convention 511R, Requisition; and acknowledge receipts by authorizing contract number using the DLMS Supplement 527R, Receipt, Inquiry, Response and Material Receipt Acknowledgement.</P>
            <P>(e) Only the Contractor may request authorization for subcontractor use of Government supply sources. The Contracting Officer will not grant authorizations for subcontractor use without approval of the Contractor.</P>

            <P>(f) Government invoices shall be submitted to the Contractor's billing address, and Contractor payments shall be sent to the Government remittance address specified below:
            </P>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">Contractor's Billing Address (include point of contact and telephone number):</FP>

            <P>(e) Only the Contractor may request authorization for subcontractor use of IFMS vehicles. The Contracting Officer will not grant authorization for subcontractor use without approval of the Contractor.</P>
