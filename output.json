Modification,</E> as used in this subpart, means a minor change in the details of a provision or clause that is specifically authorized by the FAR and does not alter the substance of the provision or clause (see 52.104).</P>\n  <P>(b) <E T=\"03\">Numbering</E>&#x2014;(1) <E T=\"03\">FAR provisions and clauses.</E> Subpart 52.2 sets forth the texts of all FAR provisions and clauses, each in its own separate subsection. The subpart is arranged by subject matter, in the same order as, and keyed to, the parts of the FAR. Each FAR provision or clause is uniquely identified. All FAR provision and clause numbers begin with &#x201C;52.2,&#x201D; since the text of all FAR provisions and clauses appear in subpart 52.2. The next two digits of the provision or clause number correspond to the number of the FAR subject part in which the provision or clause is prescribed. The FAR provision or clause number is then completed by a hyphen and a sequential number assigned within each section of subpart 52.2. The following example illustrates the makeup of the FAR provision or clause number:</P>\n  <GPH DEEP=\"77\" SPAN=\"1\">\n    <GID>EC01MY91.000</GID>\n  </GPH>\n  <P>(2) <E T=\"03\">Provisions or clauses that supplement the FAR.</E> (i) Provisions or clauses that supplement the FAR are&#x2014;</P>\n  <P>(A) Prescribed and included in authorized agency acquisition regulations issued within an agency to satisfy the specific needs of the agency as a whole;</P>\n  <P>(B) Prescribed and included in a regulation issued by a suborganization of an agency to satisfy the needs of that particular suborganization; or</P>\n  <P>(C) Developed for use at a suborganizational level of an agency, not meant for repetitive use, but intended to meet the needs of an individual acquisition and, thus, impractical to include in either an agency or suborganization acquisition regulation. (See 1.301(c).)</P>\n  <P>(ii) Supplemental provisions or clauses published in agency acquisition regulations shall be in full text and the prescription for the use of each shall be included. Supplemental provisions or clauses published in agency acquisition regulations shall be numbered in the same manner in which FAR provisions and clauses are numbered except that&#x2014;</P>\n  <P>(A) If it is included in an agency acquisition regulation that is published <PRTPAGE P=\"14\"/>in the <E T=\"04\">Federal Register</E> and is codified in Title 48, Code of Federal Regulations (48 CFR), the number shall be preceded by the chapter number within 48 CFR assigned by the CFR staff; and</P>\n  <P>(B) The sequential number shall be &#x201C;70&#x201D; or a higher number (see 1.303).</P>\n  <P>(iii) The sequential number at the end of the number of a provision or clause that supplements the FAR, like its counterpart at the end of any FAR provision or clause number, indicates the subsection location of the provision or clause in subpart 52.2 of the agency acquisition regulation that contains its full text. If, for example, an agency acquisition regulation contains only one provision followed by only one clause supplementing the FAR in its section 52.236 (Construction and Architect-Engineer Contracts), then the sequential numbers would be &#x201C;70&#x201D; for the provision and &#x201C;71&#x201D; for the clause.</P>\n  <P>(c) <E T=\"03\">Prescriptions.</E> Each provision or clause in subpart 52.2 is prescribed at that place in the FAR text where the subject matter of the provision or clause receives its primary treatment. The prescription includes all conditions, requirements, and instructions for using the provision or clause and its alternates, if any. The provision or clause may be referred to in other FAR locations.</P>\n  <P>(d) <E T=\"03\">Introductory text.</E> Within subpart 52.2, the introductory text of each provision or clause includes a cross-reference to the location in the FAR subject text that prescribes its use.</P>\n  <P>(e) <E T=\"03\">Matrix.</E> (1) The matrix in subpart 52.3 contains a column for each principal type and/or purpose of contract (e.g., fixed-price supply, cost reimbursement research and development). The matrix lists the&#x2014;</P>\n  <P>(i) Required solicitation provisions;</P>\n  <P>(ii) Required-when-applicable solicitation provisions;</P>\n  <P>(iii) Optional solicitation provisions;</P>\n  <P>(iv) Required contract clauses;</P>\n  <P>(v) Required-when-applicable contract clauses; and</P>\n  <P>(vi) Optional contract clauses.</P>\n  <P>(2) For each provision or clause listed, the matrix provides information on&#x2014;</P>\n  <P>(i) Whether incorporation by reference is or is not authorized (see 52.102);</P>\n  <P>(ii) The section of the Uniform Contract Format (UCF) in which it is to be located, if it is used in an acquisition that is subject to the UCF;</P>\n  <P>(iii) Its number;</P>\n  <P>(iv) The citation of the FAR text that prescribes its use; and</P>\n  <P>(v) Its title.</P>\n  <P>(3) Since the matrix does not provide sufficient information to determine the applicability of a provision or clause in the &#x201C;required-when-applicable&#x201D; and &#x201C;optional&#x201D; categories, contracting officers shall refer to the FAR text (cited in the matrix) that prescribes its use.</P>\n  <P>(4) The FAR matrix may be reproduced at agency levels, and at subordinate levels, for the purpose of supplementing it with agency-developed provisions and clauses. The resulting consolidated matrices may be included in agency acquisition regulations.</P>\n  <P>(f) <E T=\"03\">Dates.</E> Since they are subject to revision from time to time, all provisions, clauses, and alternates are dated; e.g., (DEC 1983). To avoid questions concerning which version of any provision, clause, or alternate is operative in any given solicitation or contract, its date shall be included whether it is incorporated by reference or in full text.</P>\n  <CITA>[48 FR 42478, Sept. 19, 1983; 48 FR 43273, Sept. 22, 1983, as amended at 55 FR 3887, Feb. 5, 1990; 62 FR 40237, July 25, 1997; 62 FR 64927, Dec. 9, 1997; 65 FR 36016, June 6, 2000; 66 FR 2134, Jan. 10, 2001]</CITA>\n</SECTION><SECTION>\n  <SECTNO>52.102</SECTNO>\n  <SUBJECT>Incorporating provisions and clauses.</SUBJECT>\n  <P>(a) Provisions and clauses should be incorporated by reference to the maximum practical extent, rather than being incorporated in full text, even if they&#x2014;</P>\n  <P>(1) Are used with one or more alternates or on an optional basis;</P>\n  <P>(2) Are prescribed on a &#x201C;substantially as follows&#x201D; or &#x201C;substantially the same as&#x201D; basis, provided they are used verbatim;</P>\n  <P>(3) Require modification or the insertion by the Government of fill-in material (see 52.104); or<PRTPAGE P=\"15\"/>\n          </P>\n  <P>(4) Require completion by the offeror or prospective contractor.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability <PRTPAGE P=\"61\"/>because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</P>\n    <P>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &#xA7; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</P>\n    <P>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer.</P>\n    <P>(C) Invoices may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer) to the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative.</P>\n    <P>(D) When requested by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative, the Contractor shall substantiate invoices (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment, individual daily job timecards, records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract, or other substantiation specified in the contract.</P>\n    <P>(E) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis.<PRTPAGE P=\"68\"/>\n            </P>\n    <P>(<E T=\"03\">1</E>) If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves overtime work in advance, overtime rates shall be negotiated.</P>\n    <P>(<E T=\"03\">2</E>) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.</P>\n    <P>(<E T=\"03\">3</E>) If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer.</P>\n    <P>(ii) <E T=\"03\">Materials</E>.</P>\n    <P>(A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at FAR 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall be the contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the&#x2014;</P>\n    <P>(<E T=\"03\">1</E>) Quantities being acquired; and</P>\n    <P>(<E T=\"03\">2</E>) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements.</P>\n    <P>(B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor&#x2014;</P>\n    <P>(<E T=\"03\">1</E>) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or</P>\n    <P>(<E T=\"03\">2</E>) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice.</P>\n    <P>(C) To the extent able, the Contractor shall&#x2014;</P>\n    <P>(<E T=\"03\">1</E>) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and</P>\n    <P>(<E T=\"03\">2</E>) Give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that are identifiable to the contract.</P>\n    <P>(D) <E T=\"03\">Other Costs</E>. Unless listed below, other direct and indirect costs will not be reimbursed.</P>\n    <P>(<E T=\"03\">1</E>) <E T=\"03\">Other Direct Costs</E>. The Government will reimburse the Contractor on the basis of actual cost for the following, provided such costs comply with the requirements in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(B) of this clause: [Insert each element of other direct costs (<E T=\"03\">e.g., travel, computer usage charges, etc. Insert &#x201C;None&#x201D; if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided. If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert &#x201C;Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided, insert &#x2018;None&#x2019;&#x201D;.</E>]</P>\n    <P>(<E T=\"03\">2</E>) <E T=\"03\">Indirect Costs (Material Handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.</E>). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [<E T=\"03\">Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule. Insert &#x201C;$0&#x201D; if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert &#x201C;Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert &#x2018;None&#x2019;).&#x201D;</E>]</P>\n    <P>(2) <E T=\"03\">Total cost</E>. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.</P>\n    <P>(3) <E T=\"03\">Ceiling price</E>. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended <PRTPAGE P=\"69\"/>and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price.</P>\n    <P>(4) <E T=\"03\">Access to records</E>. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer):</P>\n    <P>(i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract;</P>\n    <P>(ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment&#x2014;</P>\n    <P>(A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic);</P>\n    <P>(B) The Contractor's timekeeping procedures;</P>\n    <P>(C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and</P>\n    <P>(D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices.</P>\n    <P>(iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost&#x2014;</P>\n    <P>(A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and</P>\n    <P>(B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices.</P>\n    <P>(5) <E T=\"03\">Overpayments/Underpayments</E>. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractor's payment will be made by check. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on an invoice payment, the Contractor shall&#x2014;</P>\n    <P>(i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the&#x2014;</P>\n    <P>(A) Circumstances of the overpayment (<E T=\"03\">e.g.</E>, duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment);</P>\n    <P>(B) Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable;</P>\n    <P>(C) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and</P>\n    <P>(D) Contractor point of contact.</P>\n    <P>(ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer.</P>\n    <P>(6)(i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, as provided in section 611 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-563), which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid.</P>\n    <P>(ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract.</P>\n    <P>(iii) <E T=\"03\">Final Decisions</E>. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if&#x2014;</P>\n    <P>(A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt in a timely manner;</P>\n    <P>(B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or</P>\n    <P>(C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see FAR 32.607-2).</P>\n    <P>(iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment.</P>\n    <P>(v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates:</P>\n    <P>(A) The date fixed under this contract.</P>\n    <P>(B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination.</P>\n    <P>(vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on&#x2014;</P>\n    <P>(A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor;</P>\n    <P>(B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or</P>\n    <P>(C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor.</P>\n    <P>(vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract.</P>\n    <P>(viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the <PRTPAGE P=\"70\"/>&#x201C;completion invoice&#x201D; and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion.</P>\n    <P>(7) <E T=\"03\">Release of claim</E>s. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions.</P>\n    <P>(i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor.</P>\n    <P>(ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier.</P>\n    <P>(iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents.</P>\n    <P>(8) <E T=\"03\">Prompt payment</E>. The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.</P>\n    <P>(9) <E T=\"03\">Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT</E>). If the Government makes payment by EFT, see 52.212-5(b) for the appropriate EFT clause.</P>\n    <P>(10) <E T=\"03\">Discount</E>. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made.</P>\n    <P>(l) <E T=\"03\">Termination for the Government's convenience</E>. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided.</P>\n  </EXTRACT>\n  <CITA>[60 FR 48254, Sept. 18, 1995, as amended at 61 FR 45773, Aug. 29, 1996; 62 FR 12711, Mar. 14, 1997; 63 FR 9052, Feb. 23, 1998; 64 FR 10542, Mar. 4, 1999; 66 FR 2139, Jan. 10, 2001; 66 FR 53485, Oct. 22, 2001; 66 FR 65350, Dec. 18, 2001; 68 FR 56675, 56683, Oct. 1, 2003; 70 FR 57455, Sept. 30, 2005; 71 FR 74677, Dec. 12, 2006; 73 FR 54005, Sept. 17, 2008; 74 FR 14636, Mar. 31, 2009; 75 FR 34260, June 16, 2010]</CITA>\n</SECTION><SECTION>\n  <SECTNO>52.212-5</SECTNO>\n  <SUBJECT>Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders&#x2014;Commercial Items.</SUBJECT>\n  <P>As prescribed in 12.301(b)(4), insert the following clause:</P>\n  <EXTRACT>\n    <HD SOURCE=\"HD1\">Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders&#x2014;Commercial Items (OCT 2010)</HD>\n    <P>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:</P>\n    <P>(1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).</P>\n    <P>(2) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (AUG 1996) (31 U.S.C. 3553).</P>\n    <P>(3) 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (OCT 2004) (Pub.

The Contractor may, when appropriate, reduce this refund or credit by the amount of any applicable tax credits due the Contractor under 26 U.S.C. 1481 and by the amount of previous refunds or credits effected under this clause. If any portion of the excess has been applied to the liquidation of progress payments, then that portion may, instead of being refunded, be added to the unliquidated progress payment account consistent with the Progress Payments clause. The Contractor shall provide complete details to support any claimed reductions in refunds.</P>\n    <P>(3) If the Contractor fails to submit the quarterly statement within 45 days after the end of each quarter and it is later determined that the Government has overpaid the Contractor, the Contractor shall repay the excess to the Government immediately.

All other elements of the termination shall be resolved in accordance with other applicable clauses of this contract.</P>\n    <P>(m) <E T=\"03\">Equitable adjustments under other clauses.</E> If an equitable adjustment in the contract price is made under any other clause of this contract before the total final price is established, the adjustment shall be made in the total target cost and may be made in the maximum dollar limit on the total final price, the total target profit, or both. If the adjustment is made after the total final price is established, only the total final price shall be adjusted.</P>\n    <P>(n) <E T=\"03\">Exclusion from target price and total final price.</E> If any clause of this contract provides that the contract price does not or will not include an amount for a specific purpose, then neither any target price nor the total final price includes or will include any amount for that purpose.</P>\n    <P>(o) <E T=\"03\">Separate reimbursement.</E> If any clause of this contract expressly provides that the cost of performance of an obligation shall be at Government expense, that expense shall not be included in any target price or in the total final price, but shall be reimbursed separately.</P>\n    <P>(p) <E T=\"03\">Taxes.</E> As used in the Federal, State, and Local Taxes clause or in any other clause that provides for certain taxes or duties to be included in, or excluded from, the contract price, the term <E T=\"03\">contract price</E> includes the total target price or, if it has been established, the total final price. When any of these clauses requires that the contract price be increased or decreased as a result of changes in the obligation of the Contractor to pay or bear the burden of certain taxes or duties, the increase or decrease shall be made in the total target price or, if it has been established, in the total final price, so that it will not affect the Contractor's profit or loss on this contract.</P>\n  </EXTRACT>\n  <PRTPAGE P=\"118\"/>\n  <HD SOURCE=\"HD3\">(End of clause)</HD>\n  <NOTE>\n    <HD SOURCE=\"HED\">Notes:</HD>\n    <P>(1) The degree of completion may be based on a percentage of contract performance or any other reasonable basis.</P>\n    <P>(2) The language may be changed to describe a negotiated adjustment pattern under which the extent of adjustment is not the same for all levels of cost variation.</P>\n  </NOTE>\n  <P><E T=\"03\">Alternate I</E> (APR 1984).

Encourage these employees to seek or to prepare for, through appropriate training, etc., opportunities for promotion.</P>\n    <P>(13) Ensure that seniority practices, job classifications, work assignments, and other personnel practices, do not have a discriminatory effect by continually monitoring all personnel and employment-related activities to ensure that the Contractor's obligations under this contract are being carried out.</P>\n    <P>(14) Ensure that all facilities and company activities are nonsegregated except that separate or single-user rest rooms and necessary dressing or sleeping areas shall be provided to assure privacy between the sexes.</P>\n    <P>(15) Maintain a record of solicitations for subcontracts for minority and female construction contractors and suppliers, including circulation of solicitations to minority and female contractor associations and other business associations.</P>\n    <P>(16) Conduct a review, at least annually, of all supervisors' adherence to and performance under the Contractor's equal employment policy and affirmative action obligations.</P>\n    <P>(h) The Contractor is encouraged to participate in voluntary associations that may assist in fulfilling one or more of the affirmative action obligations contained in subparagraphs (g)(1) through (16) of this clause. The efforts of a contractor association, joint contractor-union, contractor-community, or similar group of which the contractor is a member and participant may be asserted as fulfilling one or more of its obligations under subparagraphs (g)(1) through (16) of this clause, provided the Contractor&#x2014;</P>\n    <P>(1) Actively participates in the group;</P>\n    <P>(2) Makes every effort to ensure that the group has a positive impact on the employment of minorities and women in the industry;</P>\n    <P>(3) Ensures that concrete benefits of the program are reflected in the Contractor's minority and female workforce participation;</P>\n    <P>(4) Makes a good-faith effort to meet its individual goals and timetables; and</P>\n    <P>(5) Can provide access to documentation that demonstrates the effectiveness of actions taken on behalf of the Contractor. The obligation to comply is the Contractor's, and failure of such a group to fulfill an obligation shall not be a defense for the Contractor's noncompliance.<PRTPAGE P=\"161\"/>\n            </P>\n    <P>(i) A single goal for minorities and a separate single goal for women shall be established.

Consequently, the Contractor may be in violation of Executive Order 11246, as amended, if a particular group is employed in a substantially disparate manner.</P>\n    <P>(j) The Contractor shall not use goals or affirmative action standards to discriminate against any person because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.</P>\n    <P>(k) The Contractor shall not enter into any subcontract with any person or firm debarred from Government contracts under Executive Order 11246, as amended.</P>\n    <P>(l) The Contractor shall carry out such sanctions and penalties for violation of this clause and of the Equal Opportunity clause, including suspension, termination, and cancellation of existing subcontracts, as may be imposed or ordered under Executive Order 11246, as amended, and its implementing regulations, by the OFCCP. Any failure to carry out these sanctions and penalties as ordered shall be a violation of this clause and Executive Order 11246, as amended.</P>\n    <P>(m) The Contractor in fulfilling its obligations under this clause shall implement affirmative action procedures at least as extensive as those prescribed in paragraph (g) of this clause, so as to achieve maximum results from its efforts to ensure equal employment opportunity.

It includes all such persons regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a Contractor or subcontractor and such persons.</P>\n    <P>(b) <E T=\"03\">Applicability.</E> This contract is subject to the following provisions and to all other applicable provisions of the Act and regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR part 4). This clause does not apply to contracts or subcontracts administratively exempted by the Secretary of Labor or exempted by 41 U.S.C. 356, as interpreted in subpart C of 29 CFR part 4.</P>\n    <P>(c) <E T=\"03\">Compensation.</E> (1) Each service employee employed in the performance of this contract by the Contractor or any subcontractor shall be paid not less than the minimum monetary wages and shall be furnished fringe benefits in accordance with the wages and fringe benefits determined by the Secretary of Labor, or authorized representative, as <PRTPAGE P=\"169\"/>specified in any wage determination attached to this contract.</P>\n    <P>(2)(i) If a wage determination is attached to this contract, the Contractor shall classify any class of service employee which is not listed therein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination) so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed class of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined pursuant to the procedures in this paragraph (c).</P>\n    <P>(ii) This conforming procedure shall be initiated by the Contractor prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employee. The Contractor shall submit Standard Form (SF) 1444, Request for Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate, to the Contracting Officer no later than 30 days after the unlisted class of employee performs any contract work. The Contracting Officer shall review the proposed classification and rate and promptly submit the completed SF 1444 (which must include information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the employees' authorized representatives or the employees themselves together with the agency recommendation), and all pertinent information to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration U.S. Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour Division will approve, modify, or disapprove the action or render a final determination in the event of disagreement within 30 days of receipt or will notify the Contracting Officer within 30 days of receipt that additional time is necessary.</P>\n    <P>(iii) The final determination of the conformance action by the Wage and Hour Division shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer who shall promptly notify the Contractor of the action taken. Each affected employee shall be furnished by the Contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination.</P>\n    <P>(iv)(A) The process of establishing wage and fringe benefit rates that bear a reasonable relationship to those listed in a wage determination cannot be reduced to any single formula. The approach used may vary from wage determination to wage determination depending on the circumstances. Standard wage and salary administration practices which rank various job classifications by pay grade pursuant to point schemes or other job factors may, for example, be relied upon. Guidance may also be obtained from the way different jobs are rated under Federal pay systems (Federal Wage Board Pay System and the General Schedule) or from other wage determinations issued in the same locality. Basic to the establishment of any conformable wage rate(s) is the concept that a pay relationship should be maintained between job classifications based on the skill required and the duties performed.</P>\n    <P>(B) In the case of a contract modification, an exercise of an option, or extension of an existing contract, or in any other case where a Contractor succeeds a contract under which the classification in question was previously conformed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause, a new conformed wage rate and fringe benefits may be assigned to the conformed classification by indexing (i.e., adjusting) the previous conformed rate and fringe benefits by an amount equal to the average (mean) percentage increase (or decrease, where appropriate) between the wages and fringe benefits specified for all classifications to be used on the contract which are listed in the current wage determination, and those specified for the corresponding classifications in the previously applicable wage determination. Where conforming actions are accomplished in accordance with this paragraph prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employees, the Contractor shall advise the Contracting Officer of the action taken but the other procedures in subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause need not be followed.</P>\n    <P>(C) No employee engaged in performing work on this contract shall in any event be paid less than the currently applicable minimum wage specified under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended.</P>\n    <P>(v) The wage rate and fringe benefits finally determined under this subparagraph (c)(2) of this clause shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay the unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or finally determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act and this contract.</P>\n    <P>(vi) Upon discovery of failure to comply with subparagraph (c)(2) of this clause, the Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the date such class or classes of employees commenced contract work.</P>\n    <P>(3) <E T=\"03\">Adjustment of Compensation.</E> If the term of this contract is more than 1 year, the minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits required to be paid or furnished thereunder to service employees under this contract shall be subject to adjustment after 1 year and not less often than once every 2 years, under <PRTPAGE P=\"170\"/>wage determinations issued by the Wage and Hour Division.</P>\n    <P>(d) <E T=\"03\">Obligation to Furnish Fringe Benefits.</E> The Contractor or subcontractor may discharge the obligation to furnish fringe benefits specified in the attachment or determined under subparagraph (c)(2) of this clause by furnishing equivalent combinations of bona fide fringe benefits, or by making equivalent or differential cash payments, only in accordance with subpart D of 29 CFR part 4.</P>\n    <P>(e) <E T=\"03\">Minimum Wage.</E> In the absence of a minimum wage attachment for this contract, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any person performing work under this contract (regardless of whether the person is a service employee) less than the minimum wage specified by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Nothing in this clause shall relieve the Contractor or any subcontractor of any other obligation under law or contract for payment of a higher wage to any employee.</P>\n    <P>(f) <E T=\"03\">Successor Contracts.</E> If this contract succeeds a contract subject to the Act under which substantially the same services were furnished in the same locality and service employees were paid wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, in the absence of the minimum wage attachment for this contract setting forth such collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any service employee performing any of the contract work (regardless of whether or not such employee was employed under the predecessor contract), less than the wages and fringe benefits provided for in such collective bargaining agreement, to which such employee would have been entitled if employed under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for under such agreement. No Contractor or subcontractor under this contract may be relieved of the foregoing obligation unless the limitations of 29 CFR 4.1b(b) apply or unless the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's authorized representative finds, after a hearing as provided in 29 CFR 4.10 that the wages and/or fringe benefits provided for in such agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, or determines, as provided in 29 CFR 4.11, that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations. Where it is found in accordance with the review procedures provided in 29 CFR 4.10 and/or 4.11 and parts 6 and 8 that some or all of the wages and/or fringe benefits contained in a predecessor Contractor's collective bargaining agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, and/or that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations, the Department will issue a new or revised wage determination setting forth the applicable wage rates and fringe benefits. Such determination shall be made part of the contract or subcontract, in accordance with the decision of the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board, as the case may be, irrespective of whether such issuance occurs prior to or after the award of a contract or subcontract (53 Comp. Gen. 401 (1973)). In the case of a wage determination issued solely as a result of a finding of substantial variance, such determination shall be effective as of the date of the final administrative decision.</P>\n    <P>(g) <E T=\"03\">Notification to Employees.</E> The Contractor and any subcontractor under this contract shall notify each service employee commencing work on this contract of the minimum monetary wage and any fringe benefits required to be paid pursuant to this contract, or shall post the wage determination attached to this contract. The poster provided by the Department of Labor (Publication WH 1313) shall be posted in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite. Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of section 2(a)(4) of the Act and of this contract.</P>\n    <P>(h) <E T=\"03\">Safe and Sanitary Working Conditions.</E> The Contractor or subcontractor shall not permit any part of the services called for by this contract to be performed in buildings or surroundings or under working conditions provided by or under the control or supervision of the Contractor or subcontractor which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to the health or safety of the service employees. The Contractor or subcontractor shall comply with the safety and health standards applied under 29 CFR part 1925.</P>\n    <P>(i) <E T=\"03\">Records.</E> (1) The Contractor and each subcontractor performing work subject to the Act shall make and maintain for 3 years from the completion of the work, and make them available for inspection and transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, a record of the following:</P>\n    <P>(i) For each employee subject to the Act&#x2014;</P>\n    <P>(A) Name and address and social security number;</P>\n    <P>(B) Correct work classification or classifications, rate or rates of monetary wages paid and fringe benefits provided, rate or rates of payments in lieu of fringe benefits, and total daily and weekly compensation;<PRTPAGE P=\"171\"/>\n            </P>\n    <P>(C) Daily and weekly hours worked by each employee; and</P>\n    <P>(D) Any deductions, rebates, or refunds from the total daily or weekly compensation of each employee.</P>\n    <P>(ii) For those classes of service employees not included in any wage determination attached to this contract, wage rates or fringe benefits determined by the interested parties or by the Administrator or authorized representative under the terms of paragraph (c) of this clause. A copy of the report required by subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause will fulfill this requirement.</P>\n    <P>(iii) Any list of the predecessor Contractor's employees which had been furnished to the Contractor as prescribed by paragraph (n) of this clause.</P>\n    <P>(2) The Contractor shall also make available a copy of this contract for inspection or transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division.</P>\n    <P>(3) Failure to make and maintain or to make available these records for inspection and transcription shall be a violation of the regulations and this contract, and in the case of failure to produce these records, the Contracting Officer, upon direction of the Department of Labor and notification to the Contractor, shall take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until the violation ceases.</P>\n    <P>(4) The Contractor shall permit authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to conduct interviews with employees at the worksite during normal working hours.</P>\n    <P>(j) <E T=\"03\">Pay Periods.</E> The Contractor shall unconditionally pay to each employee subject to the Act all wages due free and clear and without subsequent deduction (except as otherwise provided by law or Regulations, 29 CFR part 4), rebate, or kickback on any account. These payments shall be made no later than one pay period following the end of the regular pay period in which the wages were earned or accrued. A pay period under this Act may not be of any duration longer than semi-monthly.</P>\n    <P>(k) <E T=\"03\">Withholding of Payments and Termination of Contract.</E> The Contracting Officer shall withhold or cause to be withheld from the Government Prime Contractor under this or any other Government contract with the Prime Contractor such sums as an appropriate official of the Department of Labor requests or such sums as the Contracting Officer decides may be necessary to pay underpaid employees employed by the Contractor or subcontractor. In the event of failure to pay any employees subject to the Act all or part of the wages or fringe benefits due under the Act, the Contracting Officer may, after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the Contractor, take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply with the requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the Government may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the Contractor in default with any additional cost.</P>\n    <P>(l) <E T=\"03\">Subcontracts.</E> The Contractor agrees to insert this clause in all subcontracts subject to the Act.</P>\n    <P>(m) <E T=\"03\">Collective Bargaining Agreements Applicable to Service Employees.</E> If wages to be paid or fringe benefits to be furnished any service employees employed by the Government Prime Contractor or any subcontractor under the contract are provided for in a collective bargaining agreement which is or will be effective during any period in which the contract is being performed, the Government Prime Contractor shall report such fact to the Contracting Officer, together with full information as to the application and accrual of such wages and fringe benefits, including any prospective increases, to service employees engaged in work on the contract, and a copy of the collective bargaining agreement. Such report shall be made upon commencing performance of the contract, in the case of collective bargaining agreements effective at such time, and in the case of such agreements or provisions or amendments thereof effective at a later time during the period of contract performance such agreements shall be reported promptly after negotiation thereof.</P>\n    <P>(n) <E T=\"03\">Seniority List.</E> Not less than 10 days prior to completion of any contract being performed at a Federal facility where service employees may be retained in the performance of the succeeding contract and subject to a wage determination which contains vacation or other benefit provisions based upon length of service with a Contractor (predecessor) or successor (29 CFR 4.173), the incumbent Prime Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names, of all service employees on the Contractor's or subcontractor's payroll during the last month of contract performance.

This lowering can be detrimental in obtaining the quality of professional services needed for adequate contract performance. It is therefore in the Government's best interest that professional employees, as defined in 29 CFR 541, be properly and fairly compensated. As a part of their proposals, offerors will submit a total compensation plan setting forth salaries and fringe benefits proposed for the professional employees who will work under the contract. The Government will evaluate the plan to assure that it reflects a sound management approach and understanding of the contract requirements. This evaluation will include an assessment of the offeror's ability to provide uninterrupted high-quality work. The professional compensation proposed will be considered in terms of its impact upon recruiting and retention, its realism, and its consistency with a total plan for compensation. Supporting information will include data, such as recognized national and regional compensation surveys and studies of professional, public and private organizations, used in establishing the total compensation structure.</P>\n    <P>(b) The compensation levels proposed should reflect a clear understanding of work <PRTPAGE P=\"175\"/>to be performed and should indicate the capability of the proposed compensation structure to obtain and keep suitably qualified personnel to meet mission objectives. The salary rates or ranges must take into account differences in skills, the complexity of various disciplines, and professional job difficulty. Additionally, proposals envisioning compensation levels lower than those of predecessor contractors for the same work will be evaluated on the basis of maintaining program continuity, uninterrupted high-quality work, and availability of required competent professional service employees. Offerors are cautioned that lowered compensation for essentially the same professional work may indicate lack of sound management judgment and lack of understanding of the requirement.</P>\n    <P>(c) The Government is concerned with the quality and stability of the work force to be employed on this contract. Professional compensation that is unrealistically low or not in reasonable relationship to the various job categories, since it may impair the Contractor's ability to attract and retain competent professional service employees, may be viewed as evidence of failure to comprehend the complexity of the contract requirements.</P>\n    <P>(d) Failure to comply with these provisions may constitute sufficient cause to justify rejection of a proposal.</P>\n  </EXTRACT>\n  <HD SOURCE=\"HD3\">(End of provision)</HD>\n  <CITA>[48 FR 42478, Sept. 19, 1983, as amended at 57 FR 60582, Dec. 21, 1992]</CITA>\n</SECTION><SECTION>\n  <SECTNO>52.222-47</SECTNO>\n  <RESERVED>[Reserved]</RESERVED>\n</SECTION><SECTION>\n  <SECTNO>52.222-48</SECTNO>\n  <SUBJECT>Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment Certification.</SUBJECT>\n  <P>As prescribed in 22.1006(e)(1), insert the following provision:</P>\n  <EXTRACT>\n    <HD SOURCE=\"HD1\">Exemption From Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment Certification (FEB 2009)</HD>\n    <P>(a) The offeror shall check the following certification:</P>\n    <P>CERTIFICATION</P>\n    <P>The offeror &#x25A1; does &#x25A1;  does not certify that&#x2014;</P>\n    <P>(1) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Government purposes, and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontractor) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;</P>\n    <P>(2) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of equipment.</P>\n    <P>(i) An &#x201C;established catalog price&#x201D; is a price included in a catalog, price list, schedule, or other form that is regularly maintained by the manufacturer or the offeror, is either published or otherwise available for inspection by customers, and states prices at which sales currently, or were last, made to a significant number of buyers constituting the general public.</P>\n    <P>(ii) An &#x201C;established market price&#x201D; is a current price, established in the usual course of trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain, which can be substantiated from sources independent of the manufacturer or offeror; and</P>\n    <P>(3) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract are the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.</P>\n    <P>(b) Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.

However, in individual cases, the requirement for an agreement may be waived by the agency upon a showing by the Contractor or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States, or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.</P>\n    <P>(h) <E T=\"03\">March-in rights</E>.

This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by paragraph (e)(2) of this clause. The Contractor shall instruct such employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, as to the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.</P>\n    <P>(5) Subject to FAR 27.302(i), the Contractor agrees that the Government may duplicate and disclose subject invention disclosures and all other reports and papers furnished or required to be furnished pursuant to this clause.</P>\n    <P>(f) <E T=\"03\">Examination of records relating to inventions</E>.

The Contracting Officer will not withhold any amount under this paragraph while the amount specified by this paragraph is being withheld under other provisions of the contract. The withholding of any amount or the subsequent payment shall not be construed as a waiver of any Government rights.</P>\n    <P>(h) <E T=\"03\">Preference for United States industry</E>. Unless provided otherwise, neither the Contractor nor any assignee shall grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless the person agrees that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement may be waived by the agency upon a showing by the Contractor or assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that, under the circumstances, domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.</P>\n    <P>(i) <E T=\"03\">Subcontracts</E>. (1) The Contractor shall include the substance of the patent rights clause required by FAR Subpart 27.3 in all subcontracts for experimental, developmental, or research work.

If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performing this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performing this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.</P>\n    <P>(e) <E T=\"03\">Ceiling price</E>.

When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price.</P>\n    <P>(f) <E T=\"03\">Audit</E>. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may request audit of the vouchers and supporting documentation. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding vouchers, that are found by the Contracting Officer or authorized representative not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. Upon receipt and approval of the voucher designated by the Contractor as the &#x201C;completion voucher&#x201D; and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract (including, without limitation, terms relating to patents and the terms of paragraph (g) of this clause), the Government shall promptly pay any balance due the Contractor.

The Contractor shall repay the Government an amount equal to the unliquidated progress payments that are based on costs allocable to property that is lost, stolen, damaged, or  destroyed.</P>\n    <P>(f) <E T=\"03\">Control of costs and property.</E> The Contractor shall maintain an accounting system and controls adequate for the proper administration of this clause.</P>\n    <P>(g) <E T=\"03\">Reports, forms, and access to records.</E> (1) The Contractor shall promptly furnish reports, certificates, financial statements, and other pertinent information (including estimates to complete) reasonably requested by the Contracting Officer for the administration of this clause.

Costs incurred which are subject to this limitation shall be segregated on Contractor progress payment requests and invoices from those costs eligible for higher progress payment rates.

If this contract is administered by other than the contracting office, the Contractor shall submit a copy of the VECP simultaneously to the Contracting Officer and to the Administrative Contracting Officer.</P>\n    <P>(e) <E T=\"03\">Government action.</E> (1) The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor of the status of the VECP within 45 calendar days after the contracting office receives it. If additional time is required, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor within the 45-day period and provide the reason for the delay and the expected date of the decision. The Government will process VECP's expeditiously; however, it will not be liable for any delay in acting upon a VECP.</P>\n    <P>(2) If the VECP is not accepted, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing, explaining the reasons for rejection. The Contractor may withdraw any VECP, in whole or in part, at any time before it is accepted by the Government. The Contracting Officer may require that the Contractor provide written notification before undertaking significant expenditures for VECP effort.</P>\n    <P>(3) Any VECP may be accepted, in whole or in part, by the Contracting Officer's award of a modification to this contract citing this clause and made either before or within a reasonable time after contract performance is completed.

Net acquisition savings are first realized, and the Contractor shall be paid a share, when Government costs and any negative instant contract savings have been fully offset against acquisition savings.</P>\n    <P>(2) Except in incentive contracts, Government costs and any price or cost increases resulting from negative instant contract savings shall be offset against acquisition savings each time such savings are realized until they are fully offset. Then, the Contractor's share is calculated by multiplying net acquisition savings by the appropriate Contractor's percentage sharing rate (see paragraph (f) above). Additional Contractor shares of net acquisition savings shall be paid to the Contractor at the time realized.</P>\n    <P>(3) If this is an incentive contract, recovery of Government costs on the instant contract shall be deferred and offset against concurrent and future contract savings. The Contractor shall share through the contract incentive structure in savings on the instant contract items affected. Any negative instant contract savings shall be added to the target cost or to the target price and ceiling price, and the amount shall be offset against concurrent and future contract savings.</P>\n    <P>(4) If the Government does not receive and accept all items on which it paid the Contractor's share, the Contractor shall reimburse the Government for the proportionate share of these payments.</P>\n    <P>(h) <E T=\"03\">Contract adjustment.</E> The modification accepting the VECP (or a subsequent modification issued as soon as possible after any negotiations are completed) shall&#x2014;</P>\n    <P>(1) Reduce the contract price or estimated cost by the amount of instant contract savings, unless this is an incentive contract;</P>\n    <P>(2) When the amount of instant contract savings is negative, increase the contract price, target price and ceiling price, target cost, or estimated cost by that amount;</P>\n    <P>(3) Specify the Contractor's dollar share per unit on future contracts, or provide the lump-sum payment;</P>\n    <P>(4) Specify the amount of any Government costs or negative instant contract savings to be offset in determining net acquisition savings realized from concurrent or future contract savings; and</P>\n    <P>(5) Provide the Contractor's share of any net acquisition savings under the instant contract in accordance with the following:</P>\n    <P>(i) Fixed-price contracts&#x2014;add to contract price.</P>\n    <P>(ii) Cost-reimbursement contracts&#x2014;add to contract fee.</P>\n    <P>(i) <E T=\"03\">Concurrent and future contract savings.</E> (1) Payments of the Contractor's share of concurrent and future contract savings shall be made by a modification to the instant contract in accordance with subparagraph (h)(5) above. For incentive contracts, shares shall be added as a separate firm-fixed-price line item on the instant contract. The Contractor shall maintain records adequate to identify the first delivered unit for 3 years after final payment under this contract.</P>\n    <P>(2) The Contracting Officer shall calculate the Contractor's share of concurrent contract savings by (i) subtracting from the reduction in price negotiated on the concurrent contract any Government costs or negative instant contract savings not yet offset and (ii) multiplying the result by the Contractor's sharing rate.</P>\n    <P>(3) The Contracting Officer shall calculate the Contractor's share of future contract savings by (i) multiplying the future unit cost reduction by the number of future contract units scheduled for delivery during the sharing period, (ii) subtracting any Government costs or negative instant contract savings not yet offset, and (iii) multiplying the result by the Contractor's sharing rate.</P>\n    <P>(4) When the Government wishes and the Contractor agrees, the Contractor's share of future contract savings may be paid in a single lump sum rather than in a series of payments over time as future contracts are awarded. Under this alternate procedure, the future contract savings may be calculated when the VECP is accepted, on the basis of the Contracting Officer's forecast of the number of units that will be delivered during the sharing period. The Contractor's share shall be included in a modification to this contract (see subparagraph (h)(3) above) and shall not be subject to subsequent adjustment.</P>\n    <P>(5) Alternate no-cost settlement method. When, in accordance with subsection 48.104-4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Government and the Contractor mutually agree to use the no-cost settlement method, the following applies:</P>\n    <P>(i) The Contractor will keep all the savings on the instant contract and on its concurrent contracts only.</P>\n    <P>(ii) The Government will keep all the savings resulting from concurrent contracts placed on other sources, savings from all future contracts, and all collateral savings.</P>\n    <P>(j) <E T=\"03\">Collateral savings.</E> If a VECP is accepted, the Contracting Officer will increase the instant contract amount, as specified in paragraph (h)(5) of this clause, by a rate from 20 to 100 percent, as determined by the Contracting Officer, of any projected collateral savings determined to be realized in a typical year of use after subtracting any Government costs not previously offset. However, the Contractor's share of collateral savings will not exceed the contract's firm-<PRTPAGE P=\"396\"/>fixed-price, target price, target cost, or estimated cost, at the time the VECP is accepted, or $100,000, whichever is greater. The Contracting Officer will be the sole determiner of the amount of collateral savings.</P>\n    <P>(k) <E T=\"03\">Relationship to other incentives.</E> Only those benefits of an accepted VECP not rewardable under performance, design-to-cost (production unit cost, operating and support costs, reliability and maintainability), or similar incentives shall be rewarded under this clause. However, the targets of such incentives affected by the VECP shall not be adjusted because of VECP acceptance. If this contract specifies targets but provides no incentive to surpass them, the value engineering sharing shall apply only to the amount of achievement better than target.</P>\n    <P>(l) <E T=\"03\">Subcontracts.</E> The Contractor shall include an appropriate value engineering clause in any subcontract of $150,000 or more and may include one in subcontracts of lesser value. In calculating any adjustment in this contract's price for instant contract savings (or negative instant contract savings), the Contractor's allowable development and implementation costs shall include any subcontractor's allowable development and implementation costs, and any value engineering incentive payments to a subcontractor, clearly resulting from a VECP accepted by the Government under this contract.

It also confers other important benefits. SAFETY Act designation and SAFETY Act certification are designed to support effective technologies aimed at preventing, detecting, identifying, or deterring acts of terrorism, or limiting the harm that such acts might otherwise cause, and which also meet other prescribed criteria. For some classes of technologies, DHS may issue a block designation/certification in order to lessen the burdens for filing for SAFETY Act designation or SAFETY Act certifications by not requiring applicants to provide certain information otherwise required and in order to offer expedited review of any application submitted pursuant to a block designation/certification.

A determination by DHS to issue a SAFETY Act designation, or not to issue a SAFETY Act designation for a particular technology as a QATT is not a determination that the technology meets, or fails to meet, the requirements of any solicitation issued by any Federal, State, local or tribal governments. Determinations by DHS with respect to whether to issue a SAFETY Act designation for technologies submitted for DHS review are based on the factors identified in 6 CFR 25.4(b).</P>\n    <P>(e) Neither SAFETY Act designation nor certification is in any way a requirement of this action.

A determination by DHS to issue a SAFETY Act designation, or not to issue a SAFETY Act designation for a particular Technology as a QATT is not a determination that the Technology meets, or fails to meet, the requirements of any solicitation issued by any Federal, State, local or tribal governments.
